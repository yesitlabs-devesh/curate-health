        American healthcare is broken. Costs continue to rise while outcomes
        remain stagnant. The bad news is this trend will continue until we
        transition from a system that focuses on saving sick patients to one
        that keeps them well. The good news is that by deploying the expertise
        of board-certified health and wellness professionals, we can change it.
        Weâ€™re on a mission to improve health outcomes and lower the cost of
        care.
